# bespoke-pdf-nw-app

This is the NW.js app used by [bespoke-pdf](http://npmjs.org/bespoke-pdf) 
to capture individual slides.

Beyond educational purposes, you may not find any independent
usefulness.

It's published as an individual module, because it has it's self
contained with it's own dependencies - this way we have an automated
install process.
